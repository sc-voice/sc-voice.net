To each Sutta you can open a graph card by clicking the graph icon <img src="img/graphicon.png" alt="graph icon"> in the top right corner.

There you see a graphic representation of how the Sutta you are reading is connected with other Suttas by the examples of the `INSPIRE ME!` list.

- the biggest dot is the Sutta from which the graph card has been opened
- blue dots are examples—mouse hover shows the example text
- other dots are connected Suttas, colored by Nikāya—mouse hover shows Sutta ID
- bigger dots are Suttas that are highest in the relevance score for the respective example
