For each sutta you can open a graph card by clicking the graph icon <img src="img/graphicon.png" alt="graph icon"> in the top right corner.

There you see a graphic representation of how the sutta you are reading is connected with other suttas by the examples of the `INSPIRE ME!` list.

- the biggest dot is the sutta from which the graph card has been opened
- blue dots are examples—mouse hover shows the example text
- other dots are connected suttas, colored by nikāya—mouse hover shows sutta ID
- bigger dots are suttas that are highest in the relevance score for the respective example
- click on any dot to get a link that will take you to that sutta or example
