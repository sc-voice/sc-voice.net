### What translators are available?
The translations offered on SuttaCentral Voice are all 
based in whole or part on 
the _Mahāsaṅgīti Pali segmented translations_ 
maintained in 
[SuttaCentral](https://suttacentral.net)
in accordance with the
[SuttaCentral content license](https://suttacentral.net/licensing?lang=en).
A "segmented translation" is one created using 
[Bilara](https://suttacentral.net/about?lang=en).
Bilara maintains a strict one-to-one correspondence 
between source and translated document at the
level of a "text segment" (about a sentence).

Since SuttaCentral Voice only supports segmented text,
many translations available on SuttaCentral 
are simply not available on SuttaCentral Voice.
As more translators use Bilara, SuttaCentral Voice
will automatically show new translators as options.
