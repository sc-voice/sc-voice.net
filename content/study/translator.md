### What translators are available?
The translations offered on SuttaCentral Voice are all 
based in whole or part on 
the Mahasangiti Pali _segmented translations_ 
maintained in 
[SuttaCentral](https://suttacentral.net)
in accordance with the
[SuttaCentral content license](https://suttacentral.net/licensing?lang=en).
A "segmented translation" is one created using 
[Bilara](https://suttacentral.net/about?lang=en).
Bilara maintains a strict one-to-one correspondence 
between source and translated document at the
level of a "text segment" (about a sentence).

Since SuttaCentral Voice only supports segmented text,
many translations available on SuttaCentral 
are simply not available on SuttaCentral Voice.
This restriction necessarily limits the selection of
translators. 
As more translators use Bilara, SuttaCentral Voice
will automatically show new translators as options.

### What is EBT-DeepL?
The EBT-DeepL translator choice
selects texts translated with the help of the 
[DeepL translation engine](https://deepl.com).
EBT-DeepL translations are not automated.
Indeed, a lot of work has to be done
preparing language specific glossaries 
for EBT-DeepL.
These glossaries are carefully prepared using
existing segmented translations 
in contemporary languages (i.e., not Pali).
In fact, since multiple contemporary segmented
translations are available, 
any EBT-DeepL translation can take advantage
of multiple sources for cross-checking
translations into the target language.
Although EBT-DeepL translations are available
on SuttaCentral Voice, we anticipate that
these translations will eventually be replaced
by new human translations.
Towards that long-term goal, 
EBT-DeepL translations
are offered here for 
potential use as rough drafts for 
eventual human translation under the 
[MIT license](https://opensource.org/license/mit/).

Many thanks to Gabriel Laera,
