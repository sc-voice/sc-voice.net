### First some Q&A

#### 1. What did the Buddha teach first?

The first discourse after his awakening was held by the Buddha near Varanasi, in the deer park at Isipatana, and he explained here the noble eigthfold path and the four noble truths. 

Read and *listen to* [SN 56.11](#/sutta/sn56.11:0.1/en/sujato); good keyword for search: “who understood”.

#### 2. What is the Buddha's teaching good for?

This question—and also what this teaching *isn't* good for—is answered wonderfully by Venerable Sāriputta in a discussion with Venerable Mahākoṭṭhita! 

Read and *listen to* [AN 9.13](#/sutta/an9.13:0.1/en/sujato); good keyword for search: “certainly not”.

#### 3. Is Buddhism a religion for scientists?

The Buddha explicitly invites us to make use of our reason. 

Read and *listen to* [AN 3.65](#/sutta/an3.65:0.1/en/sujato); good keyword for search: “doubt has come up”.

But the development of our emotional qualities, like love for example, is just as important. 

Read and *listen to* [Snp 1.8](#/sutta/snp1.8:0.1/en/sujato) or [Kp 9](#/sutta/kp9/en/sujato); good keyword for search: “on Love”. 

#### 4. Why is the canon so confusing?

Good question! The Buddhist canon is indeed anything but clearly arranged. It is ordered neither chronologically nor in a didactic way. The order we find today is explained by the history of its formation. The canon emerged from an oral tradition where it was crucial to compile collections of text of a suitable size so that it could be memorized and passed down by different groups of reciters; each collection was supposed to contain the central teaching topics. The result seems rather chaotic to us today and doesn't offer a good guiding principle for study.
