When you are in the main Wiki ToC you can select a channel (section) with the topic you are interested in, for example "Sutta sutdy with SC-Voice". Click to open the channel ToC. Select a card from there.

When hovering your mouse over a card, links are highlighted.

To get back to the main ToC or to another level you can use the breadcrumbs at the top of the Wiki card:

In the screenshot above, "study" will take you to the ToC of the "study" channel, while "wiki" takes you to the main Wiki ToC.
