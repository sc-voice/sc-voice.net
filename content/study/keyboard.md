### Cards

Content is presented within different types of **cards**:

* *Wiki card:* shows website documentation, etc.
* *Search card:*  shows search terms and search results
* *Sutta card:* shows individual suttas for segmented documents from [SuttaCentral.net](https://suttacentral.net)
* *Graph card:* shows graphic representation of how a sutta is connected with other Suttas via key phrases

Cards allow you to review multiple documents. 
On wider screens, you will even be able to compare cards side-by-side.

### Card tabs

Each card has a **tab** that can be clicked to go to the associated card.

The tab that's currently in focus has a colored underline. When a sutta card is in focus, a play module appears at the bottom of the screen.

The buttons here are from left to right: 
- jump to previous segment
- play segment in focus; pause play 
- jump to highlighted segment 
- continuous play from segment in focus; pause play
- jump to next segment

The segment in focus is highlighted by a darker color and a dotted border, its ID is found in the middle of the play module. 

Active buttons are also highlighted by a dotted border.
