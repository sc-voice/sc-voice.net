## Content channels
Organize your Markdown files into sub-folders of related content.
Each content sub-directory is known as a _channel_.

For example, here is a channel of related EBT sites:

* [Sites](#/wiki/sites/toc)

Notice that each channel has a ```toc.md``` file.

### TOC files

A *TOC file* is a special Markdown file used to generate the table
of contents for each channel.
EBT-Site will automatically update the channel table of contents whenever
you make a change to your wiki.

When you create a new channel, be sure to add a ```toc.md``` file!

### Hidden channels
It's sometimes convenient to hide a channel while you're working on it.
To hide a channel from its parent TOC, just remove or rename the ```toc.md``` file
of that channel.
