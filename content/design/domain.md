*domain names* are top-level internet names such as 
"suttacentral.net" or "google.com".
You can have your own domain name, but they are not free.
You will need to rent your domain name as long as you use it.
If you stop paying for it, someone else can and will take
the domain name.

Domain name subscriptions are available from many domain name providers.
For example, the [sc-voice.net](sc-voice.net) domain name
is rented from [Google domains](https://domains.google/).


### Apex domains

When you rent a domain name from a domain name provider,
you'll be getting an 
[apex domain name](https://www.easyredir.com/blog/what-is-an-apex-domain/)
such as **sc-voice.net**.

Once you have a custom domain name,
you'll need to attach it to your Github account and/or repository.
If you don't need any sub-domains, skip this section and set up the repository.

* Navigate to your Github account (not the repository!)
* Open ```Settings```
* Click ```Pages``` in left nav bar
* <kbd>Add a domain</kbd>
* Type in your apex domain name

Once the apex domain name is verified for your Github account,
you can use it or any of its domains in your repositories for
that account.

### Repository domain name

Once your account has a verified apex domain name, you can
assign the verified apex domain name or one of its
sub-domain names (e.g., ```ebt-site.sc-voice.net```)
to any of the repositories for that Github account.

* Navigate to the Github repository for your EBT-Site
* Open ```Settings```
* Click ```Pages``` in left nav bar
* <kbd>Add a domain</kbd>

See [Github custom domains](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/configuring-a-custom-domain-for-your-github-pages-site)
for more information. 
In particular, note that you will need to configure DNS records
for your custom domain name(s).

If you have any questions about the documentation on Github,
you should consult someone with IT experience.
